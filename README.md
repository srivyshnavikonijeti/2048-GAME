# 2048-GAME

2048 is a one-player puzzle slide game.
It is played on a 4x4 grid.
Each time after the movement it creates a tile with 
item 2 in it.
When two tiles with the same number collide, they 
combine with double the value of the tile.
To win, slide the numbers and produce a tile of 2048 
or higher
